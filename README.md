# 👋 Hi, I'm Tapas Kumar Dutta!

🚀 **Computer Vision and Machine Learning Researcher**

I am a Master's student at the **University of Surrey**, working on my thesis at the [SketchX Lab](http://sketchx.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Subhadeep Koley](https://subhadeepkoley.github.io/) and [Professor Yi-Zhe Song](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/yi-zhe-song). My research focuses on **Deep Learning, Medical Imaging, and Foundation Models**, particularly in AI-driven diagnosis tools, X-ray classification, and sketch understanding with foundation models.

I have contributed to multiple **international research teams**, collaborating with [SWLEOC](https://www.epsom-sthelier.nhs.uk/swleoc/), [Bagci Lab](https://bagcilab.com/), and [INRIA, STARS Team](https://team.inria.fr/stars/en/) on various AI-driven healthcare projects. I have also been involved in research with **OpenCV and Multi-national AI teams** across the **US, UK, France, Germany, Japan, and India**.
